	In this workshop, I learned how to restructure existing procedural programs into modules,
as well as navigating cstrings and the functionality required for them. In the first part of
the workshop, I encountered some difficulty with which headers to include and which were 
unnecessary. While it could have been possible to simply include all of the headers in each 
file, that would use extra compiler resources, and so it was important to find which header
files contained the needed struct definitions and data for other header files. 

	In the second part of the workshop, the parts that gave me the most trouble were the 
functions that used length specifiers. The issues that I came across were ensuring the functions
stopped at the correct length, and with zero-indexing, whether to start at len or len - 1. 
Also, for the functions that did not include lengths (strCpy, strStr, etc), using pointer arithmetic
was necessary since there was no upward limit of when to iterate. Without a limit on the number
of iterations (length), I had to use a while loop ending iterating over each character of the 
string until it hit a '\0' character, whereas I could have used for loops for conditions including
lengths. However, I chose to use while loops for those functions as well, the lengths added
extra exit conditions for the while loops.

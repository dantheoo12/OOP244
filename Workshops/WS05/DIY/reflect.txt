	In this workshop, I learned how to use operators as member functions as well as friend
functions. Operator overloads are very useful to write fast and simple code that can be reused
several times. However, we must be aware that while class operator overloads are useful, their
function should be very obvious and simple, otherwise we should use a different function name. 
Class operator members are very powerful and add clear and simple syntax to a class that can
make code readable, but if the definitions are not logical and obvious, the functionality of
the operator can be unclear to readers. Friend functions are also useful to create functions
to act on a class without requiring to be a member. While friend functions may initially seem
like member functions, I learned the power of using friend functions with operators to allow 
for external operator overloads to use instances of the class, which allows for more extended
use of operator overloads outside of using the class as a left side operand. 

	Overall, I had little difficulty with the coding of the workshop, but I gained a better
understanding of operator overloads and why friend functions are useful over member functions.

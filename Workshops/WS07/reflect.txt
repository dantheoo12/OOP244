In this workshop, I learned about the basics of inheritance and the powerful utility it can provide to a program.
Through inheritance, we can prevent a lot of code duplication as well as developing a basic understanding of a 
derived class through its base class. With the inheritance used in the workshop, we were able to create a Truck
class that inherited everything from a MotorVehicle class while adding extra data members and creating its own 
function overloads and friend function operator overloads, which made the class ultimately much more readable. 

I had slight difficulty with the private vs. protected data members. While the lab documentation stated to make the
data members of the MotorVehicle class private, the MotorVehicle class was actually the base class of the Truck class,
which needed its data members to function correctly. As such, I had to change the access level of the MotorVehicle
data members to protected so that the Truck class could properly inherit the data it needed without duplicating the code.

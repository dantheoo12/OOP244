	In this workshop, I learned a lot about classes, members and their privacy types.
In C, structs did not have member functions, only data members, and so being able to 
create functions specific to a class was new to me. While it was a bit tricky at first
to get used to calling member functions and relying on my previous code to work properly,
it got much easier the more I did it, and it became second nature to use . notation to 
call member functions. For the DIY section, it was also new to me when determining which
functions were to be private vs public, but I quickly got that unless a function needs
to be called externally, it is better to create it as private first. 

	The most challenging part was honestly the formatting of cout's output, which is very
different from the way that C formats output. Using different functions like width(), 
setprecision() and fill() were helpful once I figured them out, but they took a bit of 
practice with first.

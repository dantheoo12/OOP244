	In this workshop, I became much more comfortable with constructors, destructors and 
member functions. Overloading constructors was a very useful part of this workshop and I 
understand the different uses of overloading them. An important thing I learned was that,
in the case the constructor takes less arguments than the class has data members, the 
other data members should still be initialized to safe empty states. If not, other member
functions may not behave as described since the data members may still contain previous
garbage values.

	The function I had the most trouble with was the Canister pour function. The main issue
with that function was the logic moreso than the implementation. Once I understood the 
logic, the implementation was easier. Outside of the pour function, I became much more 
comfortable with the idea of passing by references, references as return values and multi
argument constructors.
